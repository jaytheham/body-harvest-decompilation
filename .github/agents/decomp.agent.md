# Decompilation Workflow

## Overview

This is a matching decompilation project for Body Harvest (N64). The goal is to create C code that, when compiled, produces the exact same assembly as the original game ROM.
Convert the named N64 assembly function to C89 code, compile it using IDO 5.3 in Docker, and compare the output against the original assembly. Update the C code iteratively until it produces byte-for-byte identical assembly.

## Project Structure

- `asm/`: Contains original assembly files from the ROM. In `nonmatchings/` each function is in its own `.s` file, others contain multiple functions.
- `src.us/`: Contains C source files.
- `include/`: Contains header files for variables, functions, and structs.
- `build/`: Contains compiled object files and the final ROM image.

## Tools

- Outside the docker container:`python tools/mips_to_c/m2c.py asm/nonmatchings/core/1000/func_80000D0C_190C.s` - Generate an initial C implementation from the original assembly.
- In the docker container:
- `docker exec -it bh-container bash -c "grep -r 'D_80047588' include/"` - Search for extern declarations.
- `docker exec -it bh-container bash -c "make -j QUIET=1"` - Build the project.
- `docker exec -it bh-container bash -c "tools/asm-differ/diff.py --no-pager --compress-matching 3 func_8011CC20_12BBD0"` - Compare original and generated assembly for a specific function.
- `docker exec -it bh-container bash -c "mips-linux-gnu-objdump -d build/src.us/overlay_gameplay/outside/missions.c.o | sed -n '/<func_8007679C_8574C>:/,/^$/p'"` - Disassemble a single function from an object file.

## Step 1: Generate C Implementation

Find the `#pragma GLOBAL_ASM(...` line in the C source file that includes the target assembly.
Use mips_to_c to create an initial C implementation from the original assembly and replace the `#pragma GLOBAL_ASM` line with the generated C code.

## Step 2: Use runSubagent to fix ALL of these unacceptable patterns in the new C code.

- Replace pointer arithmetic with struct/array access.
- All struct field accesses should use -> or . operators.
- Update void\* parameters that should be typed.
- Constructions like `(arg0 < 0x9C) ^ 1` should be converted into a more natural form `arg0 >= 0x9C`.
- Replace goto-based control flow with structured control flow (if/else, for, while).
- Replace if-do-while and do-while loops with for(;;) or while() loops where appropriate.
- Search in `/asm/` for any references to the target function to determine parameter and return types.

## Step 3: Add missing declarations.

- Add any missing declarations of data symbols used by the function to `include/variables.us.h`.
- Identify structs accessed by the function and add or update definitions in `include/structs.us.h`.
- Add or update declarations for any called functions in `include/functions.us.h` if they aren't defined in `src.us/` yet.

## Step 4: Build in Docker

Run the build inside the container:

**Expected outcome**: Build completes (SHA1 check may fail, if generated assembly does not match target).

**If compilation errors occur:**

- Check IDO error messages for syntax issues
- Simplify C code (avoid complex expressions in single statements)
- Ensure all extern symbols are declared

If build completes and checksums match: `build/bh.us.z64: OK`. The function is now decompiled and matched and you can stop work. If not, proceed to the next steps for analysis and iteration.

## Step 5: Compare with Original

Compare the original assembly and generated assembly to identify differences:

Note instruction order, registers, immediates, branch conditions

## Step 6: Iterate To Resolve Differences

Rewrite C code to match assumed original intent more closely. Think about how a person would have originally written the code in C to produce the assembly you see, avoid writing C code that looks like it was generated by a decompiler e.g. goto statements, complex expressions, pointer arithmetic, etc. Use the tools in the container to search for patterns in the original assembly and see how other functions were written to achieve similar assembly output.
Read file `DecompHints.md` and `ExampleFixes.md` for common patterns and pitfalls.
Rebuild and re-compare until the generated assembly is identical to the original. Once the build returns `build/bh.us.z64: OK` proceed to the final step.

## Step 7: Finalize

If you had to make changes to the initial C code, think about whether there is some detectable pattern or insight, and if so update `ExampleFixes.md` with those discoveries to help future decomp.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                             | Solution                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `undeclared identifier`           | Add `extern` to `include/variables.us.h`                    |
| IDO syntax error on casts         | Split into separate statements; avoid complex expressions   |
| Link error (missing symbol)       | Ensure symbol is declared with `extern` in a header         |
| Build fails but creates no output | Check for `make` syntax in container; use `make -j QUIET=1` |
| Can't find function in objdump    | Verify function name matches; rebuild first                 |
