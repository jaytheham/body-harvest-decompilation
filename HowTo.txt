Define a c file in one of the code segments:

    type: code
    subsegments:
      ...
      - [0xfd80, c, main_fd80]
      ...

Now when you `make extract` there will be:
\src.us\main_fd80.c
and individial functions as assembly in:
\asm\nonmatchings\main_fd80

Once you have a matching decomp for one of the functions replace the appropriate `#pragma GLOBAL_ASM`
in the .c file with the function definition.

Add any missing definitions to variables/structs/functions.h
