### Incorrect registers

| Target               | Current              |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| `0:    li      t8,1` | `0:    li      t0,1` |

It may be that the function params are incorrectly typed:
| Incorrect C | Matching C |
| --- | --- |
| `void func(s8 arg0, s8 arg1) {` | `void func(u8 arg0, u8 arg1) {` |

Rather than loading a value from an array/pointer into a temp variable manually to reference it multiple times - it may be correct to just directly reference the array/pointer every time: `D_80048198[arg0].unk10`
