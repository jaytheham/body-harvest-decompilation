### Constant encoding for -1 vs 255

When storing -1 to a `u8` array element, the compiler may optimize the constant to 255 (0x00FF) instead of -1 (0xFFFF), causing a mismatch in the immediate encoding.

To force the exact encoding `addiu reg, zero, -1` (0xFFFF), use a temporary `s8` variable:

```c
s8 neg_one = -1;
byteArray[index] = neg_one;
```

This prevents the compiler from optimizing the constant and ensures the correct instruction encoding.
