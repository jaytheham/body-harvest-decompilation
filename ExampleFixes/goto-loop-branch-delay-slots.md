### For vs While

For loops will produce different assembly to while loops despite the former being "converted to a while during compile" - _At least while dealing with unknown counts_
eg

```c=
i = 0;
while(setup.ailists[i].ailist)
{
    if (ID == setup.ailists[i].ID)
    {
        return setup.ailists[i].ailist;
    }
    i++;
}
//and
for (i = 0; setup.ailists[i].ailist; i++)
{
    if (ID == setup.ailists[i].ID)
    {
        return setup.ailists[i].ailist;
    }
}
```

The above are semantically the same, and due to the nature of the loop the while is recommended - however they produce different assembly and the for was correct.
