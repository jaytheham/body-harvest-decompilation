### Bit extraction pattern order

When extracting a nibble or other bit field from a word, the order of operations matters for matching assembly:

**Incorrect (simplified):**

```c
value = (*ptr >> shift) & 0xF;
```

**Correct (original pattern):**

```c
value = (s32) (*ptr & (0xF << shift)) >> shift;
```

While these are mathematically equivalent, IDO generates different instruction sequences. The original pattern produces:

- Load value into register
- Create shifted mask (0xF << shift)
- AND with mask
- Shift right

The simplified pattern can cause the compiler to optimize differently and generate non-matching assembly. Always preserve the mask-then-shift order when it appears in mips_to_c output.
